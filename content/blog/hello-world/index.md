Hello! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computing at Imperial College, advised by [Prof. Michael Bronstein](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.bronstein) and [Dr. Kirill Veselkov](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/kirill.veselkov04). My research lies in the intersection of machine learning and precision medicine. I am particularly interested in applying and developing geometric deep learning methods for precision oncology. 

I created this blog to share my research and data analyses I do as part of my PhD. The main reason being the **isolation** I feel during the COVID pandemic (funny that we actually have a couple of COVID projects going on now in my research group!). Topics will range from very 'medical' things to more technical/machine learning things. 

The current research projects I am involved in are:

- **Anticancer Hyperfoods project**: Building up from [our first study on hyperfoods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45349-y), this project focuses on introducing a graph neural network model for anticancer hyperfoods prediction. In short, we created a deep learning model to predict food molecules and foods with anticancer properties. We have just submitted this manuscript and are currently waiting for feedback.
  
- **Drug and food repositioning against COVID19**: We started this project as a result of the COVID19 pandemic. Using a machine learning model to simulate effects of drugs, food molecules and COVID19 on the genome, we aim at predicting drugs and foods to treat (or help in the recovery of) COVID19 from the group of FDA-approved drugs (drug repositioning is about using 'old drugs' for 'new purposes', reducing the time drugs takes to go into the market). A postdoc in our group is leading this project, whereas I've been collaborating in the data processing, and implementation of algorithms for biological validation of results.
  
- **Combinatorial therapeutics against COVID19**: This is the main project I am working on at the moment, which we also started due to the COVID19 pandemic (of course ha!). I am building a graph neural network model to predict potential combinatorial therapeutics (drug and food combinations) against COVID19. Tasks I need to do in this project include data processing, coding neural models, designing experiments, and validating results.
 
- **Meta-analysis of association of food items and risk of colorectal cancer**. Done in collaboration with a medical student from UCL, we are studying the association of several food items (garlic, nuts, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables and citrus fruits) and the risk cancer using meta-analyses of previously published studies. Meta-analyses aim at aggregating results from multiple studies to asses whether a statistically significant association between a risk factor and an outcome can be drawn. For this project, I carried out the meta-analyses in Stata, and we are currently in the writing process and interpretation of biological mechanisms underlying the anticancer properties of food compounds.

I hope you enjoy my blog!
